A few notes:

- If you want to develop it use "DelightApp2" as active project, - if you want to build it for a CFW create a .sis from "DelightApp" and unpack it into ROFS1
- If you have any improvement -> Pull reqeust
- If you want to run this on a non Delight phone you have to adjust the app and it requires MiniCMD
- This was my first C++ project, don't blame me
- It's using a few C++11 features, so you should use GCC 4.6.3
- The QML files got compressed long time ago for a bit more performance, the original readable files got lost

This has no license, if you use (parts) of the code please put me into your credits :)
