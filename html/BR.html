How, where and when...</p><p><u>What is the use of Backup and Restore?</u></p><p>Backup and Restore is an enhanced mode by Il.Socio of MiniCMD. By clicking on Backup or Restore you can backup or restore your system’s particular files.</p><p><u>What if I want to edit the files myself and put my own settings there?</u></p><p>Simply open Z:&#92;data&#92;BackCMD.txt or Z:&#92;data&#92;RestCMD.txt and edit them according to your taste.</p><p>Save modded files in C:&#92;data&#92;</p><p>BackCMD.txt is Backup script.</p><p>RestCMD.txt is Restore script.</p><p>Though I won’t support on how to edit it or what to put in there if you want to do a certain task. This is only for experienced modders.</p><p><u>Where does it store my Backup?</u></p><p>First of all, it will search for any old version of backup saved on your E or F drive. If it finds one, it will ask you what to do. Options can be remove older version and create a new one or overwrite the previous one. It also creates a security copy of your Backup so in case you by mistake overwrite it, you will have a backup copy of your original backup.</p><p>Then based on your choice and based on available drivers, it will start backing up your data. Do note that F drive will be its first choice but if there isn’t any F drive then it will create backup on E drive. If no drive available like your phone is connected in Mass Memory mode to your PC, it will show you an error and exit.</p><p>Else if backup proceeds, it will create Backup&Restore in F drive or in E drive if F drive is not available.</p><p>It will create BackupB&R as a security copy in the same drive where it stores your backup.</p><p><u>What exactly does it back up?</u></p><p>It gives you two options. Backup Settings including installed applications as well as backup installed Games data.</p><p>These are the settings/App’s data and games data it will back up.</p><p><u>Settings:</u></p><p>WIFI APN <br>Menu Layout<br>Notes<br>T9 Directory<br>Profiles<br>Home Screen and Widgets<br>Camera<br>Equalizer</p><p><u>App’s Data:</u></p><p>Screensnap<br>Xplore<br>Guardian<br>Nokia Maps Favourites and recent destinations<br>Tweaks Plugins DB<br>My screen orientation v2.0.2<br>FontZoomer v3.2 (Do remember to install application before run restore)<br>Fmobi<br>Nimbuzz<br>SPB Shell and Mods<br>Shazam<br>WhasApp<br>Emoji<br>Facinate<br>Sleep Screen<br>NDesk<br>Nokia Social<br>Skype<br>Facial<br>Widgelon<br>Icon Changer<br>Countdown Widget<br>MyExplorer<br>WeatherApp<br>Nokia Account</p><p><u>Games Data:</u></p><p>Angry Birds (All versions)<br>EA Monopoly<br>Asphalt<br>Nokia Filler (All versions)<br>EA Sims<br>Hunter<br>Block Breaker<br>Azkend<br>Sparkle<br>Tank Hero<br>Guitar Rock 2<br>UNO<br>Fruit Ninja (All versions)<br>Shrek<br>Assassin Creed<br>NFS<br>Gears<br>Slam Dunk<br>Incredible Circus<br>Viking Can Fly<br>Shrek Cart Racing<br>Giochi di carte MIXEL<br>PES 2011<br>Worms HD<br>Bejeweled 2<br>Lets Create a Pottery<br>Roller Coaster<br>Virtual Table Tennis<br>Impossible<br>Tetris HD<br>Fragger<br>Burn the Rope<br>Monster Pinball<br>The Game of Life<br>Power Boat Challenge</p><p><u>How does restore work?</u></p><p>Restore checks for any saved backup and then proceed. If it finds backup folder in both F and E drive, it will show you a conflict error and will ask you to remove backup folder from either E or F drive. If backup folder exists in only one drive, it will ask you to whether restore from the backup folder or from the security copy of backup.</p><p>Then once you choose your option, it will proceed with further questioning about what exactly you want to restore, your settings and app’s data or games data.</p><p>Whatever your selected options will be, it will restore based on that and in the end restart your phone and after that restart, your data will be restored.</p><p><u>I have more questions as this Guide doesn’t answer my question, what should I do?</u></p><p>Just ask in CFW offical threads (Dailymobile Forum, Symbian Developers Forum).</p><p>Well I am here only, Ain’t I? Just drop a mail at huellif@gmail.com and I will answer ASAP or write under our Blog posts.</p></big></body></html>
