This FAQ will be updated on a timely basis.</p><p><u>What version of firmware should I have on my phone to flash your latest Delight custom firmware?<br></u>As this firmware has all needed files we need, you can simply flash to it without worrying about your current firmware.</p><p><u>Can I flash with any other firmware cooker&rsquo;s custom firmware if I want after I flash with yours or the original?<br></u>Yes, of course you can. But you have to Refurbish because of the partitioning, else your phone won't boot up!</p><p><u>I tried to install a .sis(x) file, but it only shows a file corrupted error, what to do now?.<br></u>Open ROMPatcher+ and disable ReadCRoot and UnlockFilemanager(No_D), than try it again.</p><p><u>Most of my widgets are semi-transparent form, I don't like them. How can I get back my default widgets back?<br></u>Check Delight App &rarr; Extras &rarr; Selector &rarr; Choose Widget Skins</p><p><u>The maximum volume of your Custom Firmware seems to stop at 60&#037; , how to fix it?<br></u>Check Menu, Tools, ROMPatcher.<br>There's an entry which reads "HighLevelVolumeFix". Tap on it twice until a green checkmark appears next to it. Now go to ROMPatcher menu and enable "Add to Auto", else you have to repeat it after every reboot.</p><p><u>The minimum volume of your Custom Firmware seems to be a bit high, how to reduce it?<br></u>Check Menu, Tools, ROMPatcher.<br>There's an entry which reads "MoreSoundInLoudspeaker". Tap on it twice until a green checkmark appears next to it. Now go to ROMPatcher menu and enable "Add to Auto", else you have to repeat it after every reboot. As the name reads this will also boost the volume of your loudspeaker.</p><p><u>I changed my Home Screen wallpaper and now I lost the default wallpaper you included in your custom firmware, I really liked it and want to set it again as wallpaper in one of my Home Screen but I can&rsquo;t find it. Where is it?</u><br>You can find the file in Z:&#92;data&#92;Backgrounds&#92;Delight.jpg. You do need a third party file explorer like LCG X-plore to explore this area or enable the patch UnlockFilemanger(no_D) in ROMPatcher and use default Filemanager.</p><p><u>I really don&rsquo;t like your startup animation or startup sound. How can I set my own animation and sound?<br></u>You just need to put your own animation as startup.gif in C:&#92;data&#92;animations&#92; and your startup tone as startup.mp3 in C:&#92;data&#92;animations&#92; and replace with Delight's. (You also can add shutdown.mp3 and shutdown.gif). For startup/shutdown sound you have to enable warning tones in your active profile.</p><p><u>I don't like the transition effects included, how can I remove them or change them?<br></u>Set Theme effects off first via Menu&rarr; Tools&rarr; Settings&rarr; Themes&rarr; General&rarr; Theme effects&rarr; Off. Delete E:&#92;effects&#92; contents and put your own effects files in there. Now re-enable Theme effects.</p><p><u>Music player doesn't work, it shows a memory full error, but I have free space on all drives. Also the profile settings can't find any ringtones.<br></u>Disable the patch UnlockFilemanger(No_D) in ROMPatcher + and retry, if it still doesn't work reboot your phone.</p><p><u>My music is not detected by music player, what should I do?<br></u>Since there is a music mod included in my version, you need to put all your music files in E:&#92;Music or F:&#92;Music. Few members requested me to include other folders too in this mod but sorry to all I can&rsquo;t. I feel this is the best way to make searching fast and smooth. You can always cut and paste your music files in here.</p><p><u>I don't like the included fonts, how can I put my own font without flashing?<br></u>Just make 6 copies of your font named as nosnr60, nssb60, nstsb60, S60SC_C, S60TCHK_C, S60ZDIGI. Now make a new folder in C:&#92;resource&#92; as fonts and put all these files in there. Visit C:&#92;private&#92; and delete 10003a16 folder, restart your phone. Now if you want to get back your original fonts simply rename C:&#92;resource&#92;fonts&#92; folder to something else like afonts and restart your phone. If it&rsquo;s giving you any error, then make sure you don&rsquo;t have any apps running in background using that font. If even that won&rsquo;t help then remove as many individual files you can and then restart and remove the remaining files. Your default fonts will be back finally. If this solution won&rsquo;t work at all, then there is no way and there is no need to put your question in Delight thread, simple flashing will be the only way out or put your question in proper section as a new thread.</p><p><u>XYZ app is not working in my phone, what should I do?</u><br>We don&rsquo;t give support for any individual app unless we are not pretty sure that the particular app is not working in only this custom firmware, you have to read all threads related to apps compatibility and if the app&rsquo;s not there, flash with latest original Belle and then try the app there, if app works then PM us the app name about the proper bug and we will try to rectify that as soon as possible in next update. And we don't support warez or illegal apps.</p><p><u>What&rsquo;s so special about this installserver mod you included in your custom firmware by CODeRUS?<br></u>Apart from that it allows you to install all the unsigned apps + removes the comonent inbuild error.<br>if you create a dir !&#92;installserver&#92; it will copy the content of every .sis(x) into it</p><p><u>I want other writing/UI languages also other than English, what should I do?<br></u>Flash with provided ROFS2/ROFS3 with writing/UI languages by freaxs_r_us.<br>Check Change logs section on our blog n8delight.blogspot.com for more info. Else wait for a translated version...</p><p><u>I am not able to connect to my PC in USB mode?<br></u>Make sure you don't have UnlockFilemanger(No_D) and Open4All patch activated in Rompatcher, disable them and you will be able to connect.</p><p><u>I am not able to install Qt apps which I have downloaded from net and it&rsquo;s showing me download error?<br></u>Usually apps with Smart installer creates problem while installing and downloading. Enable internet (WIFI or mobile) and it should work.</big></p></body></html>
