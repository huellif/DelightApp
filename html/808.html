You shared my passion, and helped spread the word about it. For that, I will forever be grateful.<br><br>While on December 25th it was my final planned update for Nokia 808 PureView, I hope that I will in some way release another update if you will support me with finding soluble open points, modding stuff, by positive feedback, or any other way :)<br><br>Max Bondarchenko a.k.a. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Crazy Doctor &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>max_bondarchenko@yahoo.co.uk</span></big></p><p><big><center><u>Delight Belle v1.7</u></center></big></p><p><u>Changes:</u><br>- Support for custom language ROFS by request. NOTE: old ROFS2 are compatible no more!<br>- Added or updated a couple of extra ROMPatcher+ patches; not needed ones were removed.<br>- Added Qt IAP components.<br>- Added MemSpy, the most powerful and hard-core task manager for Symbian that you have ever seen, because it was made by Nokia Corporation to help developers!<br>- MicroSD card in notification bar and camera custom resolutions are obligatory mods now.<br>- Removed My Nokia. It is not needed on FP2 firmware.<br>- Privacy policy and Product improvement are wiped away from Settings.<br>- Added Python 2.2.2 and 2.5.4 with extra modules.

Now you can install the latest version of Car Mode (v.2.0.28) or Car Mode with MirrorLink, if you need to...<br>- Restored Internet Connection Popup (just like in PR 1.0 or 1.1, thanks to ExtraX7).
